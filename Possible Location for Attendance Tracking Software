So to add to the list of possible implementations for our software system:

Professors' Offices: Professors can have students swipe Id cards to track office hours so that professors can begin to track the number of students they help. This should then allow the professors to be able to track any meaningful data patterns within the data. As an aside from this, you can also create incentive programs for the professors that help the most students. This should in turn boost productivity because it should create competition within the professors to get an incentive. 


Financial Aid Offices: Instead of asking for the student's CIN, which is the current method to check-in at the CSULA financial aid office, students can use the card swipe system to check-in.
Using a card swiping system should also boost productivity here because the check-in process becomes automatic, thus, allowing faster retrieval of student data.


Library Entrance & Exit: There is currently no system in place to track the number of students that enter and exit the library on a daily basis. I think that if we are able to track the number of students, or the number of people that enter the library, it could help you determine whether you need to increase or decrease your budget in accordance with the number of people that use your facility.


Any place where attendance or appointments are required. Using CSULA as our testing facility, our Attendance Software can be implemented in any office, or service location where student check-ins, or just regular attendance is required.
